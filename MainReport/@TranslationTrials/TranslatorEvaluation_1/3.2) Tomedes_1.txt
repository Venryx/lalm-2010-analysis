It is important to take a stance on these alternatives. The nature of the phenomena reported below tends to invite explaining away rather than being explained. “You can’t believe that sort of stuff,” and “that sort of” phenomenon usually means one that is not recognized as physically real and potentially accessible to understand based on the standard model of knowledge. People are apt to forget that what is real can only be distinguished from what is not real after examination and clarification of the nature of the phenomenon. New phenomena must be met with relevant knowledge. If it is beyond the standard model of knowledge, one must, at the very least, seek to clarify the form and substance of this novelty, and the situations in which it arises. This information must be probed in relation to available, relevant knowledge. It is only possible to assess whether one can or should proceed after such probing. This must also apply to the Lalm observations in order to be able to have confidence in the observations as sources of knowledge. Any other approach is fundamentally unscientific and results in entrenching existing knowledge while dismissing new knowledge. Our history of knowledge condemns people who did not want to see mountain ranges on the moon in Galileo Galilei’s telescope — such as representatives of the church in his day. Currently: We know that much still remains to be understood about the world in us and around us. Lalm phenomena belong among what is scientifically new and unknown.

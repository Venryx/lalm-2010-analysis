It is important to take a stand on these alternatives. The phenomena reported below are of such a nature that they easily invite description rather than explanation. "One does not believe in such", and the person in question often means by 'such' a phenomenon that is not recognized as physically real and potentially accessible for understanding based on known knowledge. One often forgets that the exceptionally is first separated from the non-real after examination and clarification of the nature of the phenomenon. New phenomena must be met with relevant knowledge. Do not extend relevant knowledge, one must as a point seek to clarify the new form and content, and the situations that arise within. This information must then be tested against available and relevant knowledge. Only after such a test will one be able to assess whether one can and should move on. This must also be the case with the observations, given that one can have confidence in the observations as a source of knowledge. Another attitude is fundamentally unscientific and leads to cementing of the existing and cutting off new recognition. Our history of knowledge has many examples of people who have not wanted to see the ring mountains on the moon in Galileo Galileo's telescope - as representatives of the sanctuary of his time did. In the present: We know that we still have a lot to do in understanding the world within us and around us. The phenomena reside within the scientifically new and unknown.

It is important to take a stand on these alternatives. The phenomena reported below are of such a nature that they easily invite to prevarications rather than to explanations. "One does not believe in such things", and the person in question often means by" such things" a phenomenon that is not recognized as physically real and potentially available for understanding based on known knowledge. One likes to forget that the real is first separated from the non-real after examination and clarification of the nature of the phenomenon. New phenomena must be met with relevant knowledge. If relevant knowledge is not sufficient, then one must as a minimum seek to clarify the new form and content, and the situations in which they arise. This information must then be tested against availability and relevant knowledge. Only after such a test will one be able to assess whether one can and should proceed. This must also be the case with the Lalm observations, given that one can have confidence in the observations as sources of knowledge. Any other approach is fundamentally unscientific and leads to cementing of the existing and cutting off of new discoveries. Our knowledge history has many examples of people who have not wished to see the ring mountains on the moon in Galileo Galileis' telescope — just like representatives of the church in his time. In the present: We know that we still have a lot to do in understanding the world around us. The Lalm phenomena belongs within the scientifically new and unknown.

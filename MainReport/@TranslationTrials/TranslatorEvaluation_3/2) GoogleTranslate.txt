It is important to take a stand on these alternatives. `The phenomena reported below are of such a nature that they easily invite explanation rather than explanation. "One does not believe such", and the person in question often means by "such" a phenomenon that is not recognized as physically real and potentially available for understanding based on known knowledge. One forgets preferably that the real is first separated from the non-real after examination and clarification of the nature of the phenomenon. New phenomena must be met with relevant knowledge. Do not stretch relevant knowledge, one must as a minimum seek to clarify the new form and content, and the situations that arise within. This information must then be tested against available and relevant knowledge. Only after such a test will one be able to assess whether one can and should move on. This must also be the case with the Lalm observations, given that one can have confidence in the observations as sources of knowledge. Another setting is fundamentally unscientific and leads to cementing of the existing and cutting off of new recognition. Our knowledge history has many examples of people who have not wish to see the ring mountains on the moon in Galileo Galiles' telescope — such as representatives of the Church his time did. In the present: We know that we still have a lot to do in understanding the world in us and around us. The Lalm phenomena belong within the scientifically new and unknown.`

`**Tricks and magic.** One or more people could think of making the initials the "presets".` This was then also the general opinion to begin with. Fast forward, and this was too unlikely in everyone's opinion. `Until then, there were too many people watching quadrants. For example, it would not be possible for one or a few people to walk around and throw objects 1<sup>1/2</sup> month without others discovering it. Incidents also occurred early which were not perceived to be compatible with the fact that individuals or groups could stand behind. The individual hand as well as the overall picture could not be understood as technically constructed. Until there are phenomena for composite, and the observations are made simultaneously, independently of each other and over time by too many people with different settings.` The kindergarten was also in full operation all the time with children and adults around each other. The motivation would be a challenge to find here as well. In addition: `One does not see a fixed pattern of person or persons associated with phenomena, cork in content, form or scope, so one would have waited.`

`**Movements with observed starting point but without associated sound.** By two hooves are the starting point of the object seen. **Lightbulb.** In one case, another small light bulb used on a Christmas tree set to lift itself up from a small basket on a free-standing kitchen counter ("the island") and fall to the floor 1-2 m away with an unnaturally loud bang and striking zigzag movement on landing. No rotation or other special conditions registered in basically. The observer perceived the total movement as somewhat slow and controlled. The path towards the impact, but not the starting point, was observed by several of a group of 20 people present. **Non-stop.** In the second case, three of the staff sat at a small one table with muffins; the nearest about 3/4 m away. Under the full supervision of all host, one of two non-stop set abruptly to disappear from one of the cakes and land with a loud bang immediately attmed. Several small magnets land immediately afterwards with a loud bang on the floor nearby. The was no mark in the melis layer beyond the imprint from the distant non-stop. In a third case is in all hove basically delimited. Children sit around the table; plastic beads fell against the floor — and kept doing so, coming from under the table after the children had laid down their hands on the table top.—`
